# Smyck Color Scheme

This is a color scheme suitable for Terminal.app, iTerm2, Vim, gVim,
MacVim, Textmate and Sublime Text 2.

The colors are carefully chosen and the contrasts are tuned so that it
should not hurt the eyes even after a whole day of working.

# Eclipse
It is recommended to use the Eclipse Color Themes plugin. It allows easy switching between different themes:

# Disclaimer

Currently its still a moving target but if you want to help, please try
it out and report screenshots of weird looking things.

There is also an Eclipse adoption of this theme available at
[https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme](https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme).

Once the final color map is done this repository will include a proper
documentation.
